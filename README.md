# Coldae++
Coldae++ is a C++ port of NetLib's COLDAE.

COLDAE uses a collocation (COL) method to solve semi-explicit differential-algebraic equations (DAE).

The original Fortran 77 code is available on [Netlib](http://www.netlib.org/ode/coldae.f).
The original authors are Uri Ascher and Ray Spiteri.
